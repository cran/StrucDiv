Description: Spatial structural diversity refers to the spatial arrangement of landscape elements and can reveal itself as landscape features, such as patches and line features. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' provides methods to quantify spatial structural diversity in continuous remote sensing data, or in other data in gridded field format. The methods are based on second-order texture metrics, considering the spatial arrangement of pixel pairs.
